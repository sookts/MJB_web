				<h3>Why choose Michael Bailey as your attorney or advisor? </h3>
					<p>I always strongly encourage families to try resolving their legal disputes through mediation first.  Unfortunately, sometimes the only way to reach a fair resolution is through litigation.  Michael Bailey has practiced family law in Alameda County for over two decades.  We are experts in the law and know the territory well.  We frequently reach beneficial settlements for our clients outside of court, which saves you time and money.  We’re also flexible about what prospective role we take in your case. Whether you would just like some assistance completing forms, prefer our more active involvement in key steps within the legal process or wish to retain us for full representation in your case, we can adapt to fit your needs and budget.</p>

				<h3>FAQ</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>How can I be sure going to court is the right path for me?</li>
							<p>Michael Bailey always recommend trying to solve matters outside of the courtroom in order to save time and money.  However, if you’ve tried to resolve matters unsuccessfully or if your former spouse or partner has already retained an attorney, it probably makes sense to protect yourself.  Whether you talk to us or another firm, it’s usually prudent at this stage to get a consultation in order to assess whether the route is the best approach for you.  We offer free consultations and we’d be happy to let you know more about what to expect before you commit anything.</p>

						<li>What if I have a limited budget?</li>
							<p>There’s no way around the fact that legal disputes generally involve at least some monetary or time investment.  One potential solution is to take on some portion of the work on your own.  In fact, Michael Bailey admires those who, either as a matter of personal preference or as a result of budgetary constraints, choose to represent themselves.  That can be a little scary, but we can help.  Our firm can provide expert advice throughout the process and provide assistance with key elements along the way.  We understand that not all people and cases require the same types of support and we have years of experience providing help where and when it’s needed.</p>

						<li>Can you represent me if I need an attorney?</li>
							<p>Absolutely.  Although we continually strive to help you avoid litigation, we are adept in family law and fully capable of providing expert legal representation in California when and where you need it.</p>

						<li>What kinds of costs can I expect to pay if I retain your firm?</li>
							<p>According to a 2006 Forbes study, the average attorney fees associated with a contested divorce trial range between $15,000 and $30,000.  We offer very competitive rates for our Bay Area clients.  We also have a great track for helping avoid litigation.  Together, those two conditions contribute significantly to minimizing your potential costs.  After our initial consultation, you’ll have a better idea about the specifics you might be facing.</p>

						<li>How would we get started?</li>
							<p>The process begins with a free consultation.  We’ll discuss your case, consider what level of support might be best to meet your needs, and discuss what you can expect in terms of process, costs and timeline.</p>
